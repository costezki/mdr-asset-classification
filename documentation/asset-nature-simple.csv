For example, class N, Arti>, has subclasses NA, Architecturei>; NB, Sculpturei>, ND, Paintingi>; as well as several other subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals, biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral , e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline.

How the terms within each facet are described varies, though in general a thesaurus-like structure is used, and usually a term is only allowed to belong to a single facet [Svenonius].

t271;t182;taxonomy;t182 taxonomy;The word ‘ taxonomy ’means the science of classifying things, and traditionally the classifi cation of plants and animals, as in the Linnaean classifi cation system. It has become a popular term now for any hierarchical classifi cation or categorization system. Thus, a taxonomy is a controlled vocabulary in which all the terms belong to a single hierarchical structure and have parent / child or broader / narrower relationships to other terms. The structure is sometimes referred to as a ‘ tree ’ . The addition of non-preferred terms / synonyms may or may not be part of a taxonomy.;0;6;tree;;;;;Hedden 2010;;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fdam.2010.29.pdf;;taxonomy ; classification (broad) ;classification ;t271;t261;t253
t271;t193;taxonomy;t193 taxonomy;A taxonomy is an orderly classification for a defined domain. It may also be known as a faceted vocabulary. It comprises controlled vocabulary terms (generally only preferred terms) organized into a hierarchical structure. Each term in a taxonomy is in one or more parent/child (broader/ narrower) relationships to other terms in the taxonomy. There can be different types of parent/child relationships, such as whole/part, genus/ species, or instance relationships. However, in good practice, all children of a given parent share the same type of relationship.;0;6;;;;;;Harpring 2013;;;;taxonomy ; classification (broad) ;classification ;t271;t261;t253

A thesaurus is a semantic network of unique concepts, including relationships between synonyms, broader and narrower (parent/child) contexts, and other related concepts.

These links are often shown by the items belonging to a broad class (CL) and defining broad and narrow terms for the item (abbreviated as BT and NT). Associative: a method to indicate relationships across hierarchies. This is expressed as related terms (abbreviated as RT).

A value vocabulary defines resources (such as instances of topics, art styles, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, a value vocabulary does not define bibliographic resources such as books but rather concepts related to bibliographic resources (persons, languages, countries, etc.). The resources in a value vocabulary are ""building blocks"" with which metadata records can be populated. Many libraries mandate specific vocabularies for selecting values for a particular metadata element. A value vocabulary thus represents a controlled list of allowed values for an element. Examples include: thesauri, code lists, term lists, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, authority files, digital gazetteers, concept schemes, and other types of knowledge organization systems. To be useful for linking of data, value vocabularies should have Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)68 Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)69 assigned for each value; these URIs would then appear in a metadata record instead of or in addition to the literal value.";1;;content vocabulary; concept vocabulary; controlled vocabulary;;;w3c;NISO TR-06-2017;https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/XGR-lld-vocabdataset-20111025/#Value_vocabularies;;controlled resource ;;;t251;;
