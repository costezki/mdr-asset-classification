Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals, biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral , e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline.

"Code lists ","They form part of the shared semantics of an ONIX message. The codelists contain a list of language-independent (often numerical) code values that are used in ONIX messages, plus for each code there is a short label and sometimes a longer note to define the meaning of the code. In principle, labels and notes may be in any language: although the meaning of almost all codes is originally defined in English, translation of labels and/or notes into another language does not alter the meaning of the code itself. Thus the meaning of an ONIX message using a particular code value is understandable and unambiguous, whatever the languages used by sender and recipient of the data.

"Value vocabulary","Vocabularies used to express concepts or values in instance data. DCMI uses the term Vocabulary Encoding Scheme for these vocabularies, which assumes more internal structure than a term list in text. (Example: Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus). A value vocabulary defines resources (such as instances of topics, art styles, or authors) that are used as values for elements in metadata records. Typically, a value vocabulary does not define bibliographic resources such as books but rather concepts related to bibliographic resources (persons, languages, countries, etc.). The resources in a value vocabulary are ""building blocks"" with which metadata records can be populated. Many libraries mandate specific vocabularies for selecting values for a particular metadata element. A value vocabulary thus represents a controlled list of allowed values for an element. Examples include: thesauri, code lists, term lists, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, authority files, digital gazetteers, concept schemes, and other types of knowledge organization systems. To be useful for linking of data, value vocabularies should have Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)68 Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)69 assigned for each value; these URIs would then appear in a metadata record instead of or in addition to the literal value.","content vocabulary, concept vocabulary, controlled vocabulary","w3c","NISO TR-06-2017","https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/XGR-lld-vocabdataset-20111025/#Value_vocabularies",""
